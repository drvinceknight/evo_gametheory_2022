# Quick Tutorial

to run, execute the following in the terminal with your desired population and weight as the terminal arguments. 

e.g. `python main.py normal 1` will run a simulation with a population where the mass is normally distribution with $\mu = 5$ and $\sigma = 12.5$. 

This code uses the [axelrod](https://axelrod.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) package to simulate Moran Processes with [heterogeneous populations](https://axelrod.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/creating_heterogenous_player_moran_process/index.html).
